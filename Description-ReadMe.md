# CSCI312Project
<p>This was the final project for my Data Structures and Algorithms class. We focused on creating a Huffman Encoding Compression program that will compress and decompress .txt files.</p>
<hr>
<p>This program is utilized via commandline arguments and utilization will be covered in this text document. <br><br>
This program also contains a design document that I worked on throughout my time of development. I updated the document frequently with current status of development of the project.</p>
<hr>
<p>In order to use this program: (Copied from design document)<br>
  <strong>Arguments</strong><br>
&emsp;The four arguments that can be passed into the program consist of the program mode, the input file, the output file, and the table file.<br>
  <strong>Program Mode</strong><br>
&emsp;The program mode is the first argument in the set of four arguments that you pass in. It can only be set to “C” or “D.” C means that you are compressing the file and D means that you are decompressing the file.<br>
  <strong>Input, Output, and Table file</strong><br>
&emsp;The three types of files that can be passed in are the input, output, and table file. These are the next three arguments that can be passed into the command line. The input file must contain data. All three files must be text files.</p>
